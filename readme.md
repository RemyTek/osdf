# Opensource defrag

Opensource Defrag is a project that aims to remake defrag, true to the original mod, using modern id-Tech3 engine and technology.  
## Goals:
### Improvement & Modernizing:
By using id-Tech3 engine, gameplay can stay true to the original.  
But, by using modern tools and technology, the game can be modernized and extended beyond its current limitations.  
See the [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) file for an overview of the project's future.  

### Gameplay:
- Maintain gameplay 1:1.  
- Achieve compatibility with existing maps. Avoid requiring any form of map porting for existing content.  
- Community collaboration in bug-fixing and further development of the mod.  

### Code & License:
- Respect OSS philosophy. Open source and community focus.  
- Rewrite the code 1:1, with the aid of reverse-engineered code only where strictly necessary.  
- Community based, where anyone can become a contributor.

## License
### SDK, but open
This project uses QIIIA Source License (aka SDK).  
All contributors accept that their specific code modifications will be dual-licensed as SDK and GPL2-or-higher.  

### Opensource commitment
This project will always remain opensourced.  
To help in preservation of this freedom:  
- All users will have their own local copy of the source code  
- This copy will always be distributed inside the mod's distribution files  
This enforces openness, by giving the community power to control the source-code, just like GPL does.
