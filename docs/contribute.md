## Agreement
By contributing to this project, you accept that:
- Your code will be opensourced
- Your code will be double-licensed as:
  - QIIIA Source License 
  - GPL2 or any higher version

## Source code licensing
### SDK
This project cannot use GPL-only code.  
If you want to take inspiration from other mods, remember this limitation.  
SDK license rules out a lot of code out there.  

### Opensource commitment
Even though the project uses SDK license, it will always remain opensourced.
To help in preservation of this freedom:
- All users will have a local copy of the source code
- Such copy should always be distributed inside the mod's distribution files
This enforces openness, by giving the community power to control the source-code, just like GPL does.

## Style guide
The information contained in the `docs/style.md` file is required for contributing.

## Building
